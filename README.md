This is a horribly dangerous tool, the only purpose of which is to actively
destroy the content of a LiveJournal account. I wrote it so I could remove
my content from LJ in protest at the April 2017 ToS change.

It's a Python script. I don't offer any support or warranty. You use it at your own risk.

It's a command-line script. You have to have Python 2.7 installed.

You have to explicitly tell the script what you want to do with your entries.
The modes are:

* `--block-out` to replace all non-whitespace text with the unicode block character 'â–ˆ' (U+2588)
* `--random-garbage` to replace all non-whitespace text with randomly chosen letters and numbers
* `--mixed-mode` to randomly choose whether to block-out or random-garbage each entry in turn
* `--delete` to just delete the entry text, which has the effect of deleting the entry completely.
* `--printout` is a test mode which doesn't change anything.

(There are other options, check out the help message.)

Note that *all* the text of an entry is replaced, including any inline HTML-like tags such as `<lj-cut>`. 

Entry subjects are affected in the same way as the entry text. The posting
date, mood, userpic, entry tags and comments are left unchanged.

**NOTE:** If you are importing your content to another site, you should make
sure that that import has finished before you run this tool.

This program will take some time to run. LJ does not allow an account to make
or update too many posts too quickly so there is a throttle-time option
(default 3 seconds, which worked for me).  With a small number of entries you
can set it to 0.

As the program runs you get a progress report. The --start-date option is
provided so you can pick up where you left off if you encounter errors.

usage: ljshred.py [-h] [--cleartext_password] [--except-latest]
                  [--start-date YYYY-MM-DD] [--end-date YYYY-MM-DD]
                  [--throttle-time THROTTLE_TIME]
                  [--printout | --block-out | --random-garbage | --mixed-mode | --delete]

Shreds all the entries in a LiveJournal.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --cleartext_password  Sends the password in (nearly) clear text, which is
                        faster but less secure
  --except-latest       Doesn't affect the latest entry
  --start-date YYYY-MM-DD
                        If given, starts shredding at the given date (e.g.
                        2017-12-31)
  --end-date YYYY-MM-DD
                        If given, stops shredding at the given date
  --throttle-time THROTTLE_TIME
                        Attempts to defeat the LJ API posting limit by waiting
                        this many seconds (default 3) between successive entry
                        updates.

Action modes (specify one):
  --printout            Only prints out all the entries it would touch,
                        doesn't actually change anything.
  --block-out           Replaces all non-whitespace text in all entries with a
                        solid block character
  --random-garbage      Replaces entries with random garbage text
  --mixed-mode          A mixture of --random-garbage and --block-out modes
  --delete              Deletes entries

This program is DANGEROUS and IRREVERSIBLE. Use at your own risk.
